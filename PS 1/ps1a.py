def greedy_cow_transport(cows,limit=10):
    """
    Uses a greedy heuristic to determine an allocation of cows that attempts to
    minimize the number of spaceship trips needed to transport all the cows. The
    returned allocation of cows may or may not be optimal.
    The greedy heuristic should follow the following method:

    1. As long as the current trip can fit another cow, add the largest cow that will fit
        to the trip
    2. Once the trip is full, begin a new trip to transport the remaining cows

    cows - a dictionary of name (string), weight (int) pairs
    limit - weight limit of the spaceship (an int)

"""Q1:  What were your results for compare_cow_transport_algorithms?  
Which algorithm runs faster?  Why?  A1:  the greedy algorithm runs faster with time of 0.000079 seconds,
compared to brute force algorithm of 0.65 seconds.  The reason the greedy algorithm runs faster is that
the efficiency of greedy algorithm is O(n^2), whereas the efficiency of brute force algortÂ¡ithms is O(n^n).

Q2: Does the greedy algorithm return the optimal solution?  WHy/Why not?  No because the greedy algorithm
returns the local optimal solution.






Q3:  Does the brute force algorithm return the optimal solution?  Yes becasue it searches all possible 
options."""
